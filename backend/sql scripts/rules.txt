Can you create a dummy data in my tables so I can test them, please?
There are some rules:
Starting with the table external_identification, the column 'type_of_identification_code' will always be "CRID", the identification I want that to be something continuous (CUST001, CUST002, CUST003, ...) and the person column I want to be a string with alpha characters, uppercase, with 16 of length, like that "0FFM30BGW2ICFQR8".
I want to have 50 different identifications with different numbers of persons (some of them must have only one person).

In the table postal_address, each person must have at least one registry.
All registries will have these columns values by default: is_party_a_person=true; organisation=NULL; status="ENAB"; is_active=true;
The column address_type can be "HOME" or "BIZZ";
The column contact_preference can be "PREF" or "NOTP" (we must have only one "PREF" for each person);

In the table phone_address, each person must have at least one registry.
All registries will have these columns values by default: extension=NULL; is_party_a_person=true; organisation=NULL;
The column number must follow the pattern: +<COUNTRY_TWO_DIGITS><9_DIGITS_PHONE_NUMBER>;
The column contact_preference can be "PREF" or "NOTP" (we must have only one "PREF" for each person);
The column sms_preference can be "PREF" or "NOTP" (we must have only one "PREF" for each person);
The column type can be "PHON", "WORK" or "MOBL";

In the table electronic_address, each person must have at least one registry.
The column contact_preference can be "PREF" or "NOTP" (we must have only one "PREF" for each person);

In the table person, each person must have only one registry (the person column of external_identification table is the identification column of person table).
All registries will have these columns values by default: brand="TEST"; financial_institution="MAT_BANK"; language="en"; status="ENAB"; vnid=NULL.

In the table agreement_involvement, each person can have multiple registries or none (the person column of external_identification table is the person column of agreement_involvement table).
All registries will have these columns values by default: party_role="AccountHolder"; is_active=true;
The column agreement  I want to be a string with alpha characters, uppercase, with 16 of length, like that "0FFM10B8AQH9ZJNN".
The rule for this table is that a person can have multiple agreements and an agreement can have multiple persons (we want to test all these cases - please identify for me what you done to make my tests easier)

In the table agreement, each agreement created in the previous table must have only one registry (the agreement column of agreement_involvement table is the identification column of agreement table).
All registries will have these columns values by default: brand="TEST"; financial_institution="MAT_BANK"; status="Enabled"; blocked_reason_code=NULL; credit_limit_amount=100000; credit_limit_currency=""; cash_limit_amount=50000; cash_limit_currency=""; closed_status_reason_code=NULL; status_changed_date_time=NULL; bill_overlimit_fee_next_cycle=false; vnid=NULL; date_to_disable=NULL; balance_cleared_date_time=NULL;
The column product can be "VISA" or "MASTER";
The column is_closed can be true or false (we want agreements with different values for testing);
The column closing_date must be filled in only if the column is_closed is true;
The column closure_request_date must be filled in only if the column is_closed is true and it must have a previous date from the closing_date;
The column is_network_account_updater_opted_out can be true or false (we want agreements with different values for testing);

In the table external_account, each agreement must have at least one registry.
The column clearing_system_identification_code can be "ACCMAT" or "ACCTALI";
The columns account_identification_code and clearing_system_member_identification I want to be a string with alpha characters and symbols, with uppercase and lowcase, with 21 of length, like that "z05p)=JP$-RsUHJ^,t456". 

Person is the identification for a real person.
Agreement is the identification for the bank account(s) of that person.

Please, do not use the values "0FFM30BGW2ICFQR8", "0FFM10B8AQH9ZJNN" and "z05p)=JP$-RsUHJ^,t456".
